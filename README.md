# gRPC Article Service

Fiddling around with gRPC because it looks cool and potentially very useful for some future projects.
This is the server side of the implementation, data is hard coded and will be re-created on each start up so changes will not be persisted.

## Future TODOs;
- Persist items to a database (probably sqlite for simplicity)
- Experiment with authorisation
